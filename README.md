# pyiwannamaker

I want to make "I Wanna Maker" levels through programming (I don't know if any others have done it), so I created this project.

It's still in development though, and I don't think I will have enough time to update this like frequently (I am just lazy) but I will try. If you can help me improve, it will be highly appreciated.
